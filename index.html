  <h3>Rules</h3>
  <p>The objective of Baccarat is to bet on the hand that will have the highest value, with 9 being the highest possible value. In Baccarat, cards 2-9 are worth their face value, 10s and face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 0, and Aces are worth 1. If the value of a hand exceeds 9, then the value is adjusted by subtracting 10 from the total.</p>
  <p>Players bet on whether the Player hand or the Banker hand will win, or if the result will be a Tie. The winning hand is the one that is closer to 9.</p>

  <div id="natural-rules" style="display:none;">
    <p>A natural hand is when either the Player or the Banker is dealt a total of 8 or 9 from their first two cards. When a natural hand is dealt, the game is over and bets are paid out accordingly.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="third-card-rules" style="display:none;">
    <p>The third card rule in baccarat is one of the ways that the dealer (or banker) has a slight house edge in the game.<p>
    <p>When the Player or the Banker has a total of 8 or 9 from their first two cards, no further cards are drawn. If the Player's total is less than or equal to 5, the Player draws a third card. If the Player does not draw a third card, the Banker draws a third card if their total is less than or equal to 5. If the Player does draw a third card, the Banker draws a third card based on the following rules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the Banker's total is 2 or less, the Banker draws a third card regardless of the Player's third card.</li>
      <li>If the Banker's total is 3, the Banker draws a third card unless the Player's third card is an 8.</li>
      <li>If the Banker's total is 4, the Banker draws a third card if the Player's third card is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</li>
      <li>If the Banker's total is 5, the Banker draws a third card if the Player's third card is 4, 5, 6, or 7.</li>
      <li>If the Banker's total is 6, the Banker draws a third card if the Player's third card is 6 or 7.</li>
      <li>If the Banker's total is 7 or higher, then the Banker does not draw a third card.</li>
    </ul>
